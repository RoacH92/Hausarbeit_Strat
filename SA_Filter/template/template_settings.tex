%% here all many commands will be set to define the loof of the report. To made it more readable "\newcommand{}" is used. 

\newcommand{\mypapersize}{A4}
%% e.g., "A4", "letter", "legal", "executive", ...
%% The size of the paper of the resulting PDF file.

\newcommand{\mydraft}{false}%% "true" for Draftmode for koma script class
%% "true" or "false",
%% if "true" overfull boxes (in margin space) are marked with black box (-> easy to spot!).
%% hyperlink from table of contents also gets disabled

\newcommand{\mydraftgraphicx}{}%% "draft" for Draftmode for graphics package
%% "draft" or "",
%% Use draft mode? If "draft", included graphics are replaced by empty rectangles (of same size)

\newcommand{\myparskip}{half}
%% e.g., "no", "full", "half", ...
%% How to separate paragraphs: indention ("no") or spacing ("half",
%% "full", ...).

\newcommand{\myBCOR}{0mm}
%% Inner binding correction. This value depends on the method which is
%% being used to bind your printed result. Some techniques do not
%% require a binding correction at all ("0mm"), other require for
%% example "5mm". Refer to KOMA script documentation for a detailed
%% explanation what a binding correction is and how to measure it.

\newcommand{\myfontsize}{12pt}   
%% e.g., 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%% The font size of the main text in pt (points).

\newcommand{\mylinespread}{1.0} 
%% e.g., 1.0, 1.5, 2.0
%% Line spacing in %/100. For example 1.5 means 150% of the usual line
%% spacing. Please use with caution: 100% ("1.0") is fine because the
%% font was designed for it.

\newcommand{\mylanguage}{english, ngerman}
%% "english,ngerman", "ngerman,english", ...
%% NOTE: The *last* language is the active one!
%% See babel documentation for further details.

\newcommand{\mydispositioncolor}{0,82,247}
%% e.g., "30,103,182" (blue/turquois), "0,0,0" (black), "0,82,247" HS Color,...
%% Color of the headings and so forth in RGB (red,green,blue) values.

\newcommand{\mycolorlinks}{true}  %% "true" or "false"
%% Enables or disables colored links (hyperref package).

\newcommand{\mytodonotesoptions}{}
%% e.g., "" (empty), "disable", ...
%% Options for the todonotes-package. If "disable", all todonotes will
%% be hidden (including listoftodos).

%% BibLaTeX-settings: (see biblatex reference for further description)
\newcommand{\mybiblatexstyle}{authoryear}

\newcommand{\mybiblatexdashed}{false}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If true: replace recurring reference authors with a dash.

\newcommand{\mybiblatexbackref}{true}  %% "true" or "false"
%% If true: create backward links from reference to citations.

\newcommand{\mybiblatexfile}{biblist.bib}
%% Name of the biblatex file that holds the references.

% \begin{verbatim}
%  \myfig{flower}%% filename w/o extension in the folder figures

%        {Home town flower}%% optional (short) caption for list of figures
%        {fig:flower}%% label
